# 02-VBA-Scripting
The goal of this project was to use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. This required creating a script that would loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year in addition to more information like yearly change, percent change, total volume of stock, displaying a ticker symbol, and displaying the greatest gains and losses. There are three screenshots and a .txt file of the vba macro.
